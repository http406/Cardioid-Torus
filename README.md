# Cardioid-Torus

### **What is a Cardioid Torus?**  
A **Cardioid Torus** is a 3D parametric surface that is generated by modifying a standard torus using a **cardioid-like deformation**. Unlike a regular torus (which has a smooth, donut-like shape), a Cardioid Torus features self-intersections, giving it a more complex and artistic structure.

It is often defined using a parametric equation where the inner and outer radii of the torus are altered by sinusoidal functions, leading to an intricate shape that appears twisted and warped.

### **How the Equation Works**  

1. **\( x \)-Coordinate (Horizontal Deformation)**  
   \[
   x = (R + r(2\sin(v) - \sin(k_1 v))) \cos(u)
   \]  
   - This controls the **horizontal positioning** of points on the torus.  
   - The term **\( 2\sin(v) - \sin(k_1 v) \)** creates a **distortion** that gives the torus a cardioid-like shape.  
   - The entire expression is multiplied by **\( \cos(u) \)**, which ensures circular rotation around the center.

2. **\( y \)-Coordinate (Vertical Deformation)**  
   \[
   y = r(2\cos(v) - \cos(k_2 v))
   \]  
   - This equation controls the **vertical positioning** of the torus' surface.  
   - The term **\( 2\cos(v) - \cos(k_2 v) \)** modifies the height of the torus and adds a cardioid-inspired curvature.

3. **\( z \)-Coordinate (Depth Deformation)**  
   \[
   z = (R + r(2\sin(v) - \sin(k_3 v))) \sin(u)
   \]  
   - This is similar to the \( x \)-coordinate equation, but it uses **\( \sin(u) \)** instead of **\( \cos(u) \)**.  
   - It ensures the torus has depth and maintains its overall circular symmetry.

### **Effects of Parameters**
- **Changing \( k_1, k_2, k_3 \)**  
  - Alters the torusâ€™ self-intersections and complexity.
  - Higher values create more **folds and deformations**.
- **Increasing \( R \) or \( r \)**  
  - Makes the torus larger or thicker.
- **Varying \( u \) and \( v \)**  
  - Controls how the shape evolves as parameters sweep through different values.

### **About Cardioid Torus**
The **Cardioid Torus** is an advanced variation of the traditional torus that introduces periodic distortions inspired by cardioid curves. By tweaking sinusoidal components, the torus gains a more **artistic, intricate, and mathematically beautiful** form.
